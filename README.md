# TerminalScope

![screenshot](./screenshot.jpg)

A very simple Python oscilloscope for displaying various dynamic data in the command line.

- Easy to integrate (no third-party libraries required, only a single Python file)
- Typical use cases:
  - Accessing your Raspberry Pi via SSH and wanting to display sensor data in real-time
  - Debugging your motor PID controller and needing a simple graphical user interface.

## TODO-list

- [ ] data range self-adaption
- [ ] individual data range
